# sketchRecognition mini project 2
Let's update our code here as we work on it locally.
please make sure every time you push your code, the whole thing works as expected: 
-- after pushing your code, download the whole file and see if it runs as expected
-- use comments so that others can understand what you are doing
-- try to write as neat and understandable code as is possible
